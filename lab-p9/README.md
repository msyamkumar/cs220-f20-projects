# Lab-P9: Plotting, Binning, and Sorting

# WARNING: Unless you took a time portal to become my student in the past, this is not the correct repository :) Please go to the correct github repository for the current semester. If you are a Fall'20 semester student though, you are in the right place.

In this lab, you'll learn to create simple plots, decode a secret
message, and take your sorting to the next level.  Have fun!

## Package Installation

For this lab, you'll need to use two new packages: `matplotlib` and
`pandas`.  We'll eventually learn a lot about these, but for now you
just need to install them and call some functions we provide.  These
and many other Python packages are available on the [PyPI site](https://pypi.org/). 
`pip install` takes care of the details of going to PyPI and installing these 
packages for you.

Once you know the name of a Python package, installing it is easy.  You just
run the following in the terminal, substituting in the package name:

```
pip install ????
```

So in this case, you should run the following (in either the Mac
Terminal or Windows PowerShell):

```
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```

You may see "Requirement already satisfied" messages (e.g., if you
already installed these by following the setup videos we provided at
the beginning of the semester), so don't be surprised if your output
looks something like this:

```
Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.23.4)
Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.5.0 in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas) (2.7.5)
Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.9.0 in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas) (1.16.0)
Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2011k in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas) (2018.9)
Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.5.0->pandas) (1.12.0)
You are using pip version 19.0.1, however version 19.0.3 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

Common issues:
* If you have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you may need to replace `pip` with `pip3`
* If neither pip command is found, you may need to replace `pip` with `python -m pip` or `python3 -m pip`.  This just means pip, although installed, is not on the PATH (i.e., your computer doesn't know where to find it)
* If you run into any other error post a screenshot of the error on Piazza

## Plotting Dictionaries

Creating a dictionary will often be the first step towards creating a
bar plot in Python.  In particular, each dictionary key might
correspond to a category (along the x-axis), and each value might
correspond to an amount (along the y-axis).  To setup plotting in
Python, paste following into two separate cells (with no other code
added):

```python
%matplotlib inline # Allows you to render plots in the same jupyter notebook
```

And in a second cell:

```python
import matplotlib, pandas

def plot_dict(d, label="Please Label Me!!!"):
    ax = pandas.Series(d).sort_index().plot.bar(color="black", fontsize=16)
    ax.set_ylabel(label, fontsize=16)
```

Let's try creating a simple dictionary and using it to create a bar plot with the `plot_dict` function:

```python
scores = {"Dogs": 9.9, "Cats": 4.1, "Humans": 8.7}
plot_dict(scores)
```

You should see something like the following:

Notice that the y-axis is missing a label; that can be specified with
an optional second argument.  Try specifying something descriptive,
like this, and observe the result:

```python
scores = {"Dogs": 9.9, "Cats": 4.1, "Humans": 8.7}
plot_dict(scores, "Likeability")
```

Now try writing a couple lines of code to produce a plot using
`plot_dict` that looks roughly like the following (feel free to use
different numbers to reflect your personal preferences):

## The Gold Bug

*The Gold Bug* is a famous story by Edgar Allan Poe about cracking a
 secret message by counting how often different symbols occur.  Take a
 moment to skim the Wikipedia article if you aren't familiar with the story:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold-Bug

The secret message in the story is the following:

```
53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8
¶60))85;;]8*;:‡*8†83(88)5*†;46(;88*96
*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*—4)8
¶8*;4069285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡
1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4
(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;
```

Complete the following code to produce a plot that shows the frequency
of each letter:

```python
lines = [
    '53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8',
    '¶60))85;;]8*;:‡*8†83(88)5*†;46(;88*96',
    '*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*—4)8',
    '¶8*;4069285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡',
    '1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4',
    '(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;',
]

# key is the symbol, value is how many times it occurred
counts = {}

for line in ????:
    for symbol in line:
        if not symbol in counts:
            counts[????] = 0
        counts[????] += 1

plot_dict(????, "Occurrences")
```

The most common letter in English is "e".  Based on your plot, can you
guess which symbol represents the letter "e"?

**Challenge:** improve the above code so that the y-axis shows percentage
of symbols rather than a raw count.  For example, the plot should
communicate that "8" represents 16% of the symbols rather merely
reporting that "8" occurs 34 times.

## Binning

Start by pasting the following code in a cell to setup the data:

```python
names = ["Ada", "Caitlin", "Abe", "Bobby", "Alice", "Britney", "Cindy", "Caleb"]
```

Your job is to determine, for each letter, the average length of names
starting with that letter.  This is a two-part task: (1) bucketize the
names based on the first letter, and (2) run a function over each
bucket of data to get a summary.

### Step 1: Bucketize

Try completing the following:

```python
buckets = {}

for name in names:
    first = name[????]
    if not first in ????:
        buckets[first] = [] # empty list
    buckets[????].append(????)

buckets
```

If you complete the above correctly, `buckets` will contain the following dict of lists:

```python
{'A': ['Ada', 'Abe', 'Alice'],
 'C': ['Caitlin', 'Cindy', 'Caleb'],
 'B': ['Bobby', 'Britney']}
```

### Step 2: Stats per Bucket

Now complete the following:

```python
def avg_len(names):
    total = 0
    for name in names:
        ???? += len(name)
    return total / len(????)

summary = {}
for k in buckets:
    summary[k] = avg_len(buckets[????])

summary
```

Your goal is for `summary` to be a dictionary where a key is the first
letter of a name, and the corresponding value is the average length of
the names starting with that letter, like this:

```python
{'A': 3.6666666666666665, 'C': 5.666666666666667, 'B': 6.0}
```

Try visualizing your result:

```python
plot_dict(summary, "Avg Name Length")
```

## Function References

Try running the following code and see what happens (try running in
Python Tutor too, if that helps):

```python
def hello():
    print("hola")

def bye():
    print("chao")

f = hello # look carefully!  We're not calling hello, because there are no parentheses
f()
f = bye
f()
f()
f = hello
f()
f()
f()
```

Now try filling in the blanks in the following code:

```python
def hello():
    print("hola")

def bye():
    print("chao")

def good_afternoon():
    print("buenas tardes")

f = ????
for i in range(????):
    f()

f = ????
f()

f = ????
for i in range(????):
    f()
```

Your goal is to get the following output:

```
hola
hola
hola
hola
buenas tardes
chao
chao
```

## Sorting

Given a list `L`, we've learned two ways to sort it:

* L.sort()
* L = sorted(L)

When a list contains simple values, the sorting is intuitive.  For
example, `sorted([3,1,2])` will return `[1,2,3]`, and `sorted(["C", "B", "A"])`
will return `["A", "B", "C"]`.  What when the list contains tuples?  Try
and find out:

```python
tups = [
    (2, "A"),
    (2, "C"),
    (1, "A"),
    (1, "C"),
    (1, "B"),
    (2, "B"),
]
sorted(tups)
```

As you can see, Python sorts by the entries at index 0 first, breaking
ties by looking at index 1, and so on.  This behavior allows us to
customize sorting.  For example, suppose we have a list of two-digit
numbers, and we want to sort based on the last digit (instead of using
the usual sorting, which places biggest numbers first).  Run this code
to see how this can be done:

```python
def get_sort_value(num):
    # extract the last digit
    return num % 10

def last_digit_sorted(nums):
    print("We want to sort these by the last digit:", nums)
    tups = []
    for num in nums:
        t = (get_sort_value(num), num)
        tups.append(t)
    print("We'll sort these tuples instead:", tups)
    tups.sort()
    print("We get these tuples:", tups)

    print("Let's extract the actual values from the tuples")
    rv = []
    for tup in tups:
        rv.append(tup[1])
    return rv

nums = [904, 703, 802, 901]
result = last_digit_sorted(nums)
print("Result:", result)
```

Try running the above code and playing with it until you understand it
("playing" means trying different numbers for `nums` and perhaps
adding prints to see what is happening).

Observe two things in the above code:
1. most of the hard work was done in `last_digit_sorted`
2. the simple `get_sort_value` function was where we actually determined which numbers would get sorted earlier or later

Python's sort functions already provide an implementation similar to
`last_digit_sorted`, and you can use it if you provide the equivalent
of `get_sort_value`.  This will require passing a reference to a
function, which Python's sort logic will call to figure out what you
want ranked first.  Let's try it:

```python
sorted(nums, key=get_sort_value)
```

This is the regular `sorted` function, but now we're passing a keyword
argument (i.e., `key`).  We're passing a reference to the
`get_sort_value` function (note that we ARE NOT invoking this function
ourselves, as there is no `()` after the function name).

Let's try another special sort.  This time, we'll sort strings so that
the longest are first. The `sorted` function also has a convenient argument
called `reverse` to help us sort the list in descending order:

```python
def sort_factor(s):
    return len(s)

vals = ["CCCCC", "AAA", "BB"]
print("Regular sorting:", sorted(vals))
print("Custom sorting:", sorted(vals, key=sort_factor, reverse = True))
```

Can you complete the following code so that strings containing the
most words are ranked first?

```python
def word_count(s):
    return ????

vals = ["A", "A A A A", "B B", "C C C"]
sorted(vals, key = ????, reverse = ????)
```

## Project Hints

* You'll be creating a few plots for P9, so consider copying the `plot_dict` function
* You'll need to answer a few questions such as "Which actors are featured in the most movies?" The easiest way to approach such questions is with a custom sort.

Good luck!
