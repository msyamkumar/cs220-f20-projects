# Lab 12: Lint, Time, and Creating DataFrames

# WARNING: Unless you took a time portal to become my student in the past, this is not the correct repository :) Please go to the correct github repository for the current semester. If you are a Fall'20 semester student though, you are in the right place.

In this lab, you'll learn three things:

1. How to run the linter
2. How to time your code
3. Different ways to construct DataFrames

## Lint

"Lint" refers to bad code that is not necessarily buggy (though "bad"
coding style often leads to bugs).  A linter helps warn you about
common issues.

For project P12, we're adding a simple linter as part of the tests.
It will notify you of code that is bad style, deducting 1% per issue
(for a max of a 10% penalty).  You can also run the linter yourself,
apart from the tests.  Let's do that now.

Read the documentation
[here](https://github.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/tree/master/linter),
install pylint and click to download [`lint.py`](https://github.com/msyamkumar/cs220-f20-projects/tree/master/lab-p12/lint.py) from the same repository.

In a new notebook (e.g., named `lint_nb.ipynb`), paste the following code:

```python
def abs(list):
    list = list[:] # copy it
    for i in range(len(list)):
        if list[i] < 0:
            list[i] = -list[i]
    return list

abs([-1, -3, 5, -4, 8])
```

Now open your terminal (Windows: PowerShell, Mac: Terminal or iTerm) and use `cd` to open the directory you are currently working on (the folder which contain the `lint_nb.ipynb` and `lint.py`), then run the linter: `python lint.py -v lint_nb.ipynb` (change the name
if necessary).  Consider why the linter is complaining, then write a
better version of the function to make the linter happy.

## Timing

Import the `time` module; this module contains a function also called
`time`.

```python
import time
```

Call the time function:

```python
time.time()
```

You should get something like `1555556468.767833`.  Call it again.
You'll get a slightly different number the second time (e.g.,
`1555556473.998879`).

The function is returning the number of seconds that have passed since
January 1st, 1970.  That's not that useful by itself, but people often
call `time.time()` twice, then subtract to find out how much time has
passed.  This is one common way to learn how efficient your code is.
You'll generally do something like this:

```python
t1 = time.time()
# some code we want to measure
t2 = time.time()
t2 - t1
```

The result on the last line will be the number of seconds it takes to
execute the code between the two `time.time()` calls.

### Measuring Addition

Let's experiment with measuring the time it takes to add the numbers
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  We'll multiply seconds by 1000 to
get milliseconds:

```python
t1 = time.time()

total = 0
limit = 10 # try changing this
for i in range(limit):
    total += i

t2 = time.time()

print("TOTAL:", total)
milliseconds = (t2-t1) * 1000
print("ms:", milliseconds)
```

What if we wanted to add numbers 1 through 100?  Try changing the
value for the `limit` variable above, and observe whether the code
runs for more milliseconds.

Keep increasing the limit (perhaps by factors of 10), until it takes
about 1000 ms (or 1 second) to run.  How many numbers can you add in
one second on your computer?

### Measuring Web Requests and File Usage

Copy the following code snippet and paste it three times, in three
separate cells (be sure to import `requests` in an earlier cell):

```python
t1 = time.time()

# code to measure

t2 = time.time()

milliseconds = (t2-t1) * 1000
print("ms:", milliseconds)
```

In each cell, replace `# code to measure` with one of the following
(in this order):

```python
import requests
r = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msyamkumar/cs220-f20-projects/master/lab-p12/hello.txt")
r.raise_for_status()
data = r.text
```

```python
f = open("hello.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")
f.write(data)
f.close()
```

```python
f = open("hello.txt", encoding="utf-8")
data = f.read()
f.close()
```

How long did the code that does a GET request using the `requests`
module take compared to the cells accessing a file on your own
computer?  It's quite likely that fetching data from the Internet took
100x longer.

### Relevance to P12

Because fetching data from the Internet is so slow, your web browser
tries to avoid downloading things more than necessary.  So, the first
time you visit a page, the web browser will download the content, and
also save it on your computer.  If you need to view the same page
again soon, your browser may use the file on your computer instead of
re-fetching the original.  This technique is called caching.

## Implementing Caching

We will now implement a `download` function with caching.
```python
import os

def download(filename, url):
    # We do not download again if the file already exists
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        return (str(filename) + " already exists!")

    # TODO: Write the code to download the file from URL
    # and save it in `filename`

    return (str(filename) + " created!")
```

Now call `download("hello.html", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msyamkumar/cs220-f20-projects/master/lab-p12/hello.html")`.
You should be able to see `hello.html` in your Explorer/Finder.

### Relevance to P12

You will have to use this `download` function to download files during P12. This will ensure
that you do not download the files multiple times.

## Creating DataFrames

Do your pandas setup:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame, Series
```

There are many ways to create pandas DataFrames.  Here are four ways
involving data structures, you are familiar with (basically every
combination of nesting):

1. `list` of `lists`
2. `dict` of `lists`
3. `list` of `dicts`
4. `dict` of `dicts`

We used to load CSV tables to lists of lists (option 1).  In that case, the list
of lists served as a list of rows.  It works the same for a DataFrame.
Try it!

```python
# option 1
DataFrame([[1,2], [3,4]])
```

In options 1 and 2, we have a mix of lists and dicts.  The important
thing to remember is this: **regardless of whether the dicts are the
inner or outer structures, the dict keys will translate to DataFrame
column names.**

This means both of these give us the same:

```python
# option 2
DataFrame([{"x":1, "y":2},
           {"x":3, "y":4}])
```

and

```python
# option 3
DataFrame({"x":[1,3],
           "y":[2,4]})
```

Finally, we have a dict of dicts.  In this case, keys of the
outer dict will be the columns of the DataFrame, and the keys of the
inner dicts will be the index of the DataFrame.  Try it!

```python
# option 4
DataFrame({"x":{"A":1,"B":3},
           "y":{"A":2,"B":4}})
```
