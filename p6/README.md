# WARNING: Unless you took a time portal to become my student in the past, this is not the correct repository :) Please go to the correct github repository for the current semester. If you are a Fall'20 semester student though, you are in the right place.

## Introduction

Data Science can help us understand user behaviors in online platform services. This project is about the rooms in Airbnb. Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. The dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.
you will be using various string manipulation functions that come with Python as well as rolling some of your own to solve the problems posed. Happy coding!

## Directions

Be sure to do [lab-p6](https://github.com/msyamkumar/cs220-f20-projects/tree/master/lab-p6) before starting this project; otherwise you probably won't get very far. Begin by downloading `airbnb.csv` and `test.py`.  Create a `main.ipynb` file to start answering the following questions, and remember to run `test.py` often.  There is no `project.py` this week, use the code from the lab to access the data.  Remember to use the `#qN` format as you have for previous projects.

### #Q1: What neighborhood groups are present in the airbnb dataset?

Generate a Python list containing the neighborhood groups. The order of the names doesn't matter but make sure that your answer doesn't contain duplicate entries.

Note: Some entries in the data set are missing neighborhood groups (real-life data is often messy,
unfortunately!).  Missing values are represented as `None`. Do not include `None` in your answer.

Now is a good time to run the tests with `python test.py`.  If you did Q1 correctly, it should look like this:

```

  Test 1: PASS
  Test 2: not found
  Test 3: not found

  Test 20: not found

TOTAL SCORE: 5.00%
```

### #Q2: What is the average price?

Be careful!  There may be missing price information for some rows. Skip rows without price information and do not include them in your calculation.

### #Q3: Count the number of rooms located in neighborhood "Chinatown"? (`neighborhood`=="Chinatown")

You can find the value "Chinatown" in the `neighborhood` column.

### #Q4: Find the room names containing "superbowl" (case insensitive)

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list.

### #Q5: Find the room names containing "dream room" (case insensitive)

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list.

### #Q6: Find the room names containing "free wifi" (case insensitive)

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list.

### #Q7: Which host names (`host_name` column) are anagrams of the phrase "landeyo"?

If you liked Professor Langdon's adventures in Da Vinci Code, you'll have fun with this one. :)

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
(Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram).  For our
purposes, we'll ignore case and spaces when considering whether two words are anagrams of each other.

Hint: although you'll need to loop over all the names to check for
anagrams, checking whether a single word is an anagram of another word
does not require writing a loop.  So if you're writing something
complicated, review the string methods and sequence operations to see
if there is a short, clever solution.

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list.

### #Q8: List all room ids that require the minimum nights greater than 365 days (`minimum_nights` > 365).

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list. Each room id has string type, not int type.

### #Q9: List all *host ids* who are hosting greater than 50 rooms. (`calculated_host_listings_count` > 50)

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list. Each host id has string type, not int type. Make sure that your answer doesn't contain duplicate entries.

### #Q10: What are the names of the cheapest rooms in Brooklyn (`neighborhood_group` == "Brooklyn")?

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list. If there is only one cheapest room, that list may contain one entry with that one cheapest room name. If more than one room has the same lowest price, then add them all to your final list.

### #Q11: What are the names of the cheapest rooms in Manhattan (`neighborhood_group` == "Manhattan")?

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list. If there is only one cheapest room, that list may contain one entry with that one cheapest room name. If more than one room has the same lowest price, then add them all to your final list.

### #Q12: What is the average ratio of the number of reviews to availiability? (Ignore rooms that has `availability_365`==0).

Your answer should be in the form of a single number of type float.

Hint1: Denominator is the availiability of a room (`availability_365` column). Numerator is the number of reviews of a room (`number_of_reviews` column). 

Hint2: Be careful! You need to compute the ratio for each room, then take the average of those ratios. Simply dividing the sum of reviews by the sum of availiability will calculate the wrong answer.

### #Q13: Which room ids have the cheapest price among rooms within (40.50 <= latitude <= 40.75, -74.00 <= longitude <= -73.95)

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list. If there is only one cheapest room, that list may contain one entry with that one cheapest room id. If more than one room has the same lowest price, then add them all to your final list.

### #Q14: Which room ids have the cheapest price among rooms within (40.75 <= latitude <= 41.00, -73.95 <= longitude <= -73.85)

Your answer should be in the form of a Python list. If there is only one cheapest room, that list may contain one entry with that one cheapest room id. If more than one room has the same lowest price, then add them all to your final list.

### #Q15: What is the average price of rooms that have greater than 300 reviews?

Your answer should be in the form of a single number of type float.

Hints

Step 1) find rooms which have greater than 300 reviews (`number_of_reviews` > 300).

Step 2) calculate their average price of rooms.

### #Q16: What is the average number of reviews of rooms that have price greater than 1000 dollars?

Your answer should be in the form of a single number of type float.

Hints

Step 1) find rooms which have price greater than 1000 dollars (`price` > 1000).

Step 2) calculate their average number of reviews.

### #Q17: What percentage of rooms whose name contains the word "sweet" also contain the word "home" in its name? (case insensitive)

Your answer should be in the form of a single number of type float.

Hint: Denominator is the number of rooms with 'sweet' in their name. Numerator is the number of rooms that have both 'sweet' and 'home' in their name.

### #Q18: What percentage of rooms whose name contains the word "pool" also contain the word "gym" in its name? (case insensitive)

Your answer should be in the form of a single number of type float.

### #Q19: What percentage of rooms whose name contains the word "five" also contain the word "stars" in its name? (case insensitive)

Your answer should be in the form of a single number of type float.

### #Q20: What is the total cost of staying in the most expensive room in Manhattan for the minimum number of nights and then staying in the most expensive room in Brooklyn for their minimum number of nights.

Your answer should be in the form of type int.

Hint: total cost = highest price in Manhattan * corresponding minimum nights + highest price in Brooklyn * corresponding minimum nights



### Please remember to `Kernel->Restart and Run All` to check for errors, save your notebook, then run the test.py script one more time before submitting the project. 

Cheers!
